abstract = "Despite progress in stereo reconstruction and structure from motion, 3D scene reconstruction from multiple images still faces many difficulties, especially in dealing with occlusions, partial visibility, textureless regions, and specular reflections. Moreover, the problem of recovering a spatially dense 3D representation from many views has not been adequately treated. This document addresses the problems of achieving a dense reconstruction from a sequence of images and analyzing and removing specular highlights. The first part describes an approach for automatically decomposing the scene into a set of spatio-temporal layers (namely EPI-tubes) by analyzing the epipolar plane image (EPI) volume. The key to our approach is to directly exploit the high degree of regularity found in the \{EPI\} volume. In contrast to past work on \{EPI\} volumes that focused on a sparse set of feature tracks, we develop a complete and dense segmentation of the \{EPI\} volume. Two different algorithms are presented to segment the input \{EPI\} volume into its component \{EPI\} tubes. The second part describes a mathematical characterization of specular reflections within the \{EPI\} framework and proposes a novel technique for decomposing a static scene into its diffuse (Lambertian) and specular components. Furthermore, a taxonomy of specularities based on their photometric properties is presented as a guide for designing further separation techniques. The validity of our approach is demonstrated on a number of sequences of complex scenes with large amounts of occlusions and specularity. In particular, we demonstrate object removal and insertion, depth map estimation, and detection and removal of specular highlights. ",

The high-speed and high-resolution pattern projection capability offered by the digital light projection technology, together with the recent advances in imaging sensor technologies, may enable new generation systems for 3D surface measurement applications that will provide much better functionality and performance than existing ones in terms of speed, accuracy, resolution, modularization, and ease of use. Performance indexes of 3D imaging system are discussed, and various 3D surface imaging schemes are categorized, illustrated, and compared. Calibration techniques are also discussed, since they play critical roles in achieving the required precision. Numerous applications of 3D surface imaging technologies are discussed with several examples.},

    abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},
